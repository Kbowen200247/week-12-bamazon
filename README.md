# week-12-bamazon

In this activity, you'll be creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills you learned this week. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, you can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.

Make sure you save and require the MySQL and Inquirer npm packages in your homework files--your app will need them for data input and storage.

## Getting Started

1. Database SQL
2. Run NPM with MySQL and Inquuirer

### Challenge #1: Customer View

1. Create a MySQL DataBase called bamazon.
2. Create a Node Application called bamazonCustomer.js

The customer app works as described in the original instructions. The customer has placed the order my applicaiton.

### Challenge #2: Manager View

The Manager app is a little different. The options within the Managerapp are View Products for Sale, View Low Inventory, Add to Inventory and Add New Product.

### Challenge #3: Supervisor View

The Supervisor App uses the Departments and creates the table sql. I have not been able to finish the product sale yet, will complete soon.
